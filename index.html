                    <h2>About Overwatch League</h2>
                    <p>The Overwatch League, the first major global esports league with city-based teams, 
                        was designed to celebrate the best of the best in the hit Blizzard Entertainment 
                        title Overwatch. Our goal is to create the world’s premier esports league, 
                        where teams and players thrive for years to come.</p>

                                <p>The preseason kicks off with a series of livestreamed exhibition matches featuring all 12 teams at the 
                                Blizzard Arena Los Angeles on December 6–9. After that, teams will have until Opening Day on January 10 
                                to prepare themselves for competition.</p>

                                Though the season is divided into four stages, wins and losses will count towards teams' full-season records 
                                and all-important seeding for the postseason.
                                 On the last Saturday of each stage, the top teams will compete for hefty bonuses and the title of stage winner.</p>
                                
                                <h4>POSTSEASON June 17 – July 28, 2018</h4>
                                <p>After Stage 4 finishes, top finishers in each division will prepare for the championship playoffs, which run from July 11–22. 
                                The grand final on July 26–28 will determine which team will be crowned the first Overwatch League champions, 
                                claiming glory, the Overwatch League trophy, and a USD $1 million bonus.</p>
                                
                                <h4>ALL-STAR WEEKEND Aug. 10 – 12, 2018</h4>
