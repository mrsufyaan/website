# Front End Web Development Website
I bulit a website based on the Overwatch League. The website icludes information on the league, the teams within and all the players.
I attempted to use an unofficial API to gather player stats as the games developer Blizzard does nt officially support one yet but I had trouble with setting it up.
## Some Sources
I got a lot of information of the leagur from [liquipedia.net](http://liquipedia.net/overwatch/Overwatch_League/Season_1/Regular_Season).
I used code from [codemyui.com](https://codemyui.com/card-ui-blog-tiles-layout-pure-css/) and adapted it in the teams page to make the logos look a little nice when hovering over them.
